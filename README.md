### Initial UI Mockups 
Our UI mockups were created on `Figma`. While the website created eventually was not exactly the same as our initial mockups, the mockups gave us a guide as to how we can start creating our User Interface. The UI Mockups can be found [here](documentation/Lab%201/CZ2006%20UI%20MockUp.pdf)

### Automated Testing
We use the `Python Selenium` library to do automated testing. The source code can be found [here](automationTest)
